# Project.Api

## About the Project

This **API**, developed using **.NET 8**, follows the principles of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to provide a structured and efficient solution for generating various reports. The main objective is to allow users to request different types of reports, with the data being processed and returned in a structured format.

The architecture of the **API** is based on **REST**, utilizing standard **HTTP** methods for efficient and simplified communication. Additionally, it is complemented by **Swagger** documentation, which provides an interactive graphical interface for developers to explore and test the endpoints easily.

### Features

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Modular structure that facilitates understanding and maintenance of the application's domain.
- **Report Generation**: Capability to generate detailed reports based on user requests.
- **RESTful API with Swagger Documentation**: Documented interface that makes integration and testing easier for developers.
